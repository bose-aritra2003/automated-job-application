Automating linkedin "Easy Apply" job application.
<br>
* Initialise the web driver with the browser you use.
* Links to web driver of most common drivers have been provided in the link-to-drivers.txt file.
* After initialising the web driver and changing all the library imports accordingly run the program.
* Input your linkedin username, password, job title/skill/name, job location and phone number.
* The program will automatically submit/save your application to at least 3 companies.

NOTE: If it crashes on the first run, run it again, it should run the second time because sometimes the linkedin sign in page opens directly when the website is accessed for the first time.
